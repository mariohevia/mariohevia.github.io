        abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are simple general-purpose optimisers often used to solve complex engineering 
                    and design problems. They mimic the process of natural evolution: they use a population of possible 
                    solutions to a problem that evolves by mutating and recombining solutions, identifying increasingly 
                    better solutions over time. Evolutionary algorithms have been applied to a broad range of problems in 
                    various disciplines with remarkable success. However, the reasons behind their success are often elusive: 
                    their performance often depends crucially, and unpredictably, on their parameter settings. It is, 
                    furthermore, well known that there are no globally good parameters, that is, the correct parameters for 
                    one problem may differ substantially to the parameters needed for another, making it harder to translate 
                    previous successfully implemented parameters to new problems. Therefore, understanding how to properly 
                    select the parameters is an important but challenging task. This is commonly known as the parameter 
                    selection problem.<br> 
                    A promising solution to this problem is the use of automated dynamic parameter selection schemes 
                    (parameter control) that allow evolutionary algorithms to identify and continuously track optimal 
                    parameters throughout the course of evolution without human intervention. In recent years the study 
                    of parameter control mechanisms in evolutionary algorithms has emerged as a very fruitful research area. 
                    However, most existing runtime analyses focus on simple problems with benign characteristics, for which 
                    fixed parameter settings already run efficiently and only moderate performance gains were shown. The 
                    aim of this thesis is to understand how parameter control mechanisms can be used on more complex and 
                    challenging problems with many local optima (multimodal problems) to speed up optimisation.<br>
                    We use advanced methods from the analysis of algorithms and probability theory to evaluate the 
                    performance of evolutionary algorithms, estimating the expected time until an algorithm finds 
                    satisfactory solutions for illustrative and relevant optimisation problems as a vital stepping stone 
                    towards designing more efficient evolutionary algorithms. We first analyse current parameter control 
                    mechanisms on multimodal problems to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently we use 
                    this knowledge to design parameter control mechanisms that mitigate the weaknesses of current 
                    mechanisms while maintaining their strengths. Finally, we show with theoretical and empirical analyses 
                    that these enhanced parameter control mechanisms are able to outperform the best fixed parameter 
                    settings on multimodal optimisation.},
