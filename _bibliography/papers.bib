abstract = {Success-based parameter control mechanisms for Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) change
the parameters every generation based on the success of the previous generation and
the current parameter value. In the last years there have been proposed several mechanisms
of success-based parameter control in the literature. The purpose of this paper is
to evaluate and compare their sequential optimisation time and parallelisation on
different types of problems. The geometric mean of the sequential and parallel optimisation
times is used as a new metric to evaluate the parallelisation of the EAs capturing
the trade off between both optimisation times. We perform an empirical study comprising
of 9 different algorithms on four benchmark functions. From the 9 algorithms eight
algorithms were taken from the literature and one is a modification proposed here.We
show that the modified algorithms has a 20% faster sequential optimisation time than
the fastest known GA on OneMax. Additionally we show the benefits of success-based
parameter control mechanisms for NP-hard problems and using the proposed metric we
also show that success-based offspring population size mechanisms are outperformed
by static choices in parallel EAs.},
