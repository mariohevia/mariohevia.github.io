For my crime mapping project, one of the biggest performance bottlenecks was pulling data live from the API, especially when requesting multiple months of data. So, I decided to move everything to a local PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for spatial support.

Rather than using a laptop 24/7 or paying for a cloud server, I used a Raspberry Pi 4 I had lying around. Itâ€™s cheap, quiet, and perfect for running a lightweight server at home. In this post, I will walk through my exact setup so you can replicate it.

### Why a Local Database?

My app used to fetch data dynamically from the UK Police. But:
- The API can be slow when requesting large time ranges
- The UK Police API is updated approximately once a month, so there's no need to fetch live data in real time
- I want to add other geospatial data like population density, employment, and others

By using PostgreSQL + PostGIS locally, I get:
- Persistent storage of API data
- Fast spatial queries using geometry indexes
- Full control over data, backups, and indexing

And all of this runs quietly on a Raspberry Pi 4 next to my router.

### Installing an Operating System into the Raspberry Pi

To install an operating system (OS) on a Raspberry Pi, you need an SD Card and the Raspberry Pi Imager, which you can download from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). 

With the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can flash the SD Card like this:

1. **Open Raspberry Pi Imager**
2. **Choose Device**: Raspberry Pi 4
3. **Choose OS**: Other general-purpose OS > Ubuntu > Ubuntu Server (64-bit)
4. **Choose storage**: Internal SD card reader
5. **OS customisation**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` for advanced settings:
- Set hostname: `pi4.local`
- Username: `myuser`
- Password: `mypassword`
- Configure wireless LAN 
- Set locale settings
- Enable SSH (use password authentication)

You can notice that I used an Ubuntu Server as OS instead of the recommended Raspberry Pi OS. This is because this Raspberry Pi will only run the PostgreSQL server and I do not want any overhead from running a full OS.

Once the SD card is flashed, remove it and plug it into the Raspberry Pi. 

### SSH and Securing the Server

After booting the Pi, connect via SSH:

```bash
# Remove old IP from known_hosts (if you reused the Pi)
nano ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Connect
ssh myuser@pi4.local
```

Then update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python-is-python3
```

Next, set up SSH keys for passwordless login:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 8192 -f ~/.ssh/pi4_rsa
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/pi4_rsa.pub myuser@pi4.local
```

Then for security, disable password SSH by running <code class="bash">sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and changing the following lines:

```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```
Finally, restart the SSH daemon (server) in the Raspberry Pi.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Installing Docker on Raspberry Pi

Now it's time to install Docker. To do so, I would recommend following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). For your convenience, I put them here too:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

Then add the Docker repo:

```bash
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Install the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Optionally, you can also allow Docker to run without root privileges by running:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in, or reboot.

### Running PostGIS in Docker

Since Raspberry Pi has an `arm64` architecture, we need a Docker image that supports it. Browsing Docker Hub, I found the [kartoza/postgis](https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/postgis) image, which comes with PostGIS pre-installed, so we do not need to create our own image.

First, I set some environment variables that will be used later (change the values as needed):

```bash
echo 'export DB_PASSWORD="mypassword"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export DB_NAME="postgis"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export DB_USER="postgres"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export DB_PORT="5432"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Then run the container using the environment variables that we set above:

```bash
docker run --name postgis-container \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=$DB_NAME \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=$DB_USER \
  -p $DB_PORT:5432 \
  -v postgis_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -d kartoza/postgis:16-3.4
```
Afterwards, you can run an interactive PostgreSQL terminal inside the container with: 

```bash
docker exec -it postgis-container su postgres -c "psql"
```

Here you can create a new database or use the one initially created, as in any other PostgreSQL server. In my case, I did:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE crime_uk;
\c crime_uk
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crimes (
    crime_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    month DATE,
    reported_by TEXT,
    falls_within TEXT,
    longitude DOUBLE PRECISION,
    latitude DOUBLE PRECISION,
    location TEXT,
    lsoa_code TEXT,
    lsoa_name TEXT,
    crime_type TEXT,
    last_outcome_category TEXT,
    context TEXT,
    geom GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS crimes_geom_idx ON crimes USING GIST (geom);
```

This SQL script creates the database `crime_uk`, then enables the PostGIS extension and creates a table with the `geom` column being a special PostGIS geometry column that stores the point location in the WGS84 coordinate system (SRID 4326). In addition, it indexes the `geom` column to accelerate spatial queries.

### Connecting from Python

This part happens **outside of Docker** but still in the Ubuntu server. If you want to use another computer other than the Raspberry Pi to connect to the database, you will need to modify the `pg_hba.conf` inside the container. I do not need this, so I will not mention how to do it here, but a simple search in your favourite search engine can tell you how to do this.

The first step to connect is to get the container IP:

```bash
docker inspect postgis-container | grep IPAddress
```

Save it as an env variable (change `172.17.0.2` for your IP):

```bash
echo 'export DB_HOST="172.17.0.2"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then, you need to install the Python dependencies. I always recommend creating an environment:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip libpq-dev
python3 -m venv envCrime
source envCrime/bin/activate
pip install pandas psycopg2 requests
```

**NOTE:** `psycopg2` requires you to install `libpq-dev`. If you do not want to install it, you can use `psycopg2-binary` instead, which has precompiled binaries. 

I will leave you with a simple example to create a connection using Python:

```python
import psycopg2
import os

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname=os.getenv("DB_NAME"),
    user=os.getenv("DB_USER"),
    password=os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
    host=os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    port=os.getenv("DB_PORT")
)

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crimes;")
print(cursor.fetchone())
conn.close()
```

Now I (and hopefully you too) have a fully local geospatial database server that runs quietly on my desk and costs nothing to operate, aside from a bit of electricity.
