I am a Research Fellow at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx) in the group of [Prof. Per&nbsp;Kristian&nbsp;Lehre](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lehrepk/). Before coming to Birmingham, I obtained a PhD degree at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Prof. Dirk Sudholt](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/intelligent-systems/) and [Prof. Pietro Oliveto](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/P.Oliveto/index.html).

My main research interests are in theory of evolutionary computation and randomized search heuristics. Currently, I&nbsp;am working on the analysis of competitive co-evolutionary algorithms.
