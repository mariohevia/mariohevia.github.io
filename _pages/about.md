I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, and optimisation. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an MSc in Data Analytics, both from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

I have published in leading AI journals and collaborated internationally, including with MIT. I have experience delivering end-to-end ML solutions, from problem definition and data preparation to model development, evaluation, and deployment. I focus on applying AI to create impactful solutions in real-world applications. I am currently seeking a role where I can apply my expertise to drive innovation and deliver meaningful results.
