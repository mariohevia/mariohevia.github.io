I am a Research Fellow at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx) in the group of [Prof. Per&nbsp;Kristian&nbsp;Lehre](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lehrepk/). Before coming to Birmingham, I obtained a PhD degree at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Prof. Dirk Sudholt](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/intelligent-systems/) and [Prof. Pietro Oliveto](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/P.Oliveto/index.html).

I have a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and AI research. Holding a PhD in Computer Science and an MSc in Data Analytics, I have published extensively in top AI journals and collaborated internationally, including with MIT. Experienced in end-to-end ML model development, deployment, and optimization. Passionate about leveraging AI for impactful solutions in real-world applications. Seeking a role where I can apply my expertise to drive innovation and make a meaningful difference.
