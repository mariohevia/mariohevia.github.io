I am a Research Fellow at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx) in the group of [Per Kristian Lehre](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lehrepk/). Before coming to Birmingham, I obtained a PhD degree at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Dirk Sudholt](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/intelligent-systems/) and [Pietro Oliveto](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/P.Oliveto/index.html).

My main research interests are in theory of evolutionary computation and randomized search heuristics. Currently I am working on the analysis of competitive co-evolutionary algorithms.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
