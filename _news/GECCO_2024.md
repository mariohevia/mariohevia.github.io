Iâ€™m excited to have attended and presented at <a href="https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/" target="_blank">GECCO 2024!</a> As always, it was a great chance to meet others and learn what everyone is researching. 

I presented the joint work <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3638529.3654132" target="_blank">A Self-adaptive Coevolutionary Algorithm</a> with my coauthors <a href="https://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/erik" target="_blank">Erik Hemberg</a>, <a href="http://www.jamal.es/" target="_blank">Jamal Toutouh</a>, <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/una-may-oreilly" target="_blank">Una-May O'Reilly</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lehrepk/" target="_blank">Per Kristian Lehre</a>.
